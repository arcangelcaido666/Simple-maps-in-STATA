This code is motivated by the precariuousness of predoctoral researchers existing in Spain (and also some job openings were requesting code repositories to check what I can do in Stata, R, .... Here you are! Hire me :) ).
Recently I had a problem when I found that my university had removed the license of ArcGIS for Ph.D. students. 
Also, after rebooting my PC i couldn't find the cracked version fo Stata that I was using, so after a couple of days  decided to buy it (a lot of money). 
Now that I have a legal Stata license and I cannot use ArcGIS anymore I found some information about creating maps and I go for that. 
Maps in Stata instead of using R or ArcGIS/QGIS? Why not? This code is adapted from the StataViz reposiroty from https://github.com/asjadnaqvi
