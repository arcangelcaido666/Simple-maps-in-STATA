Hi there! I'm new to GitHub and honestly, I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to coding. But I do have some experience with Stata, R, and ArcGIS for economic applied research.

This repository will probably include my attempts to improve map-making in Stata for my Ph.D. Most of my coding improvements come from good old trial and error.

Why this repository? Well, apart from the usual struggles of being a predoctoral researcher in Spain (and because some job listings ask for code repositories to show what I can do in Stata, R, etc. â€” so here it is! Hire me! ðŸ˜…), I recently ran into a problem when my university removed ArcGIS licenses for Ph.D. students. To make matters worse, after rebooting my PC, I lost access to the cracked version of Stata I was using. So there I was, without ArcGIS or Stata... After a few days of frustration, I bit the bullet and bought Stata (yes, it was expensive).

Now that Iâ€™ve got a legal Stata license and no more access to ArcGIS, I started learning how to create maps in Stata. If youâ€™re looking for flawless code, this might not be the place (yet!), but Iâ€™ll be uploading my improvements as I go.

Why make maps in Stata when I could use R or ArcGIS/QGIS? Well, why not? This code is inspired by the StataViz repository: https://github.com/asjadnaqvi.

This is my first time uploading code to GitHub, so donâ€™t expect anything fancy just yet. Iâ€™ve got tons of code from bigger projects sitting on my laptop, but for now, it feels overwhelming to upload it here. Maybe after a few months of learning GitHub and improving my workflow, Iâ€™ll change my mind. ðŸ˜‰
