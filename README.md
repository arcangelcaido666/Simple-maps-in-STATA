I am new here at Github, I am very noob at coding, but I have some notions on Stata, R, and ArcGIS for economic applied research.
This repository may contain my improvements on creating maps in Stata for my Ph.D.  I usually improve my code by trial an error.
This code is motivated by the precariousness of predoctoral researchers existing in Spain (and also some job openings were requesting code repositories to check what I can do in Stata, R, .... Here you are! Hire me :) ). 
Recently I had a problem when I found that my university had removed the license of ArcGIS for Ph.D. students. 
Also, after rebooting my PC I couldn't find the cracked version of Stata that I was using, so I found myself without neither ArcGIS nor STATA. After a couple of days decided to buy it (a lot of money). 
Now that I have a legal Stata license and I cannot use ArcGIS anymore I found some information about creating maps and I am learning that. I you want to find the perfect coding skills go to another repository, I will upload my improvements.
Making maps in Stata instead of using R or ArcGIS/QGIS? Why not? This code is adapted from the StataViz reposiroty https://github.com/asjadnaqvi
